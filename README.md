# Crash-Bash-Live
Unofficial Source code

The source code was extracted from the orginal site made by Team Nitro.
https://crashbash.live/

I take no owndership. 

Note: A nice project would be to make it so that users could access and play the game via by browser without the need to download. Also please feel free to correct me concerning the license of this repository (where it should fall under). Thanks.

Personally, I can't seem to get anywhere with Git LFS. As for the game files, the folder "CrashBashLIVE_Data", needs to be uploaded so progress can be made. I delegate thi task those who can better use Git LPS for large files.

Email me for the files: bendumas3@gmail.com
